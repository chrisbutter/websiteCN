    My name is Christopher Butterworth from Shaw, oldham. I am currently doing a coding course with code nation. I came to do this because I have always had an interest in anything computer related including both hardware and software. Coding has always been interesting to me but i never thought about doing a course in it. I decided it was time to do some research into coding courses and came across Code naton. At first I thought a 3 week course would not be sufficient length to learn to code but I have been surprised how much i have learnt and what job prospects i have now i have completed it.

    My hobbies and interests range from sports to technology. I am a Oldham athletic supporter who loves to both play and watch football. I  also don't mind watching some cricket and tennis but I am also a big motorsport fan. Motorsport including F1, drifting and WRC (rally) are the ones i love to watch but i also like to go driving myself and hopefully one day I'll be able to go on a track day. My other interests are more tencial which include things like computers both hardware and software. The software includes things like coding, gaming and entertainment software such as youtube, netflix and Spotify. On the hardware side I enjoy building computers which I have done, setting up my home network for devices such as smart TVâ€™s, phones and tablets. I also have a dog for whom I enjoy taking for walks and looking after and is a good way to get exercise and generally get out of the house.
