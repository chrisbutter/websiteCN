<h2> Outcome 1.1
    <P>
        The content and layout on each page is vital to the overall look and feel of the website. The first page of my website is the homepage. This is designed with the title of the website at the top and underneath that a navigation bar for quick and easy access to the other pages. After that i added a picture to help lift the look of the website and then there is a section of text about myself.  The other pages are laid out in the same way to the homepage because I wanted to keep the same design and layout for added continuity throughout the website.

        Websites can contain a large amount of data including text,pictures and videos that could be copyrighted. There are many ways to see if it's copyrighted by the use of watermarks, signature or a statement at the foot of a website. If a website uses copyrighted material it could be issued a DMCA which would require you to take down your website. To counter this you can remove the content that has breach the copyright of the owner. Music is another item that is covered by copyright so if you choose to use it on the website you need to make sure that you have the owner's permission or a license for the content.

    <P>
        Websites can be accessed by anyone at any time so it should be able to be accessed by people with disabilities such as the visually impaired. If someone is viewing your website with visibility issues there are many different techniques that can be used to help make it a better experience for them. By offering the user a choice to change the size and font of the text will make it easier for them to view. People can have a wide range of visibility issues that could be affected by the contrast of the website. So it is vital that there is an option to change the contrast of the screen to accommodate their desired preference.  The choice of colours used for either text or background can also affect the visibility of the website.  This could be an issue if you have buttons close to each other in different colours, this could cause confusion so it's best to avoid colour combinations such as red and green. The use of keyboard shortcuts could help with the interaction with the webpage by allowing people to access different sections of the page by using a shortcut instead of interacting with the buttons of the webpage. Mobile web pages could also have a one handed mode that changes the layout for use with one hand for example bring the buttons from the top a web page to the bottom right for better useability.

            There are many file types that are used for websites which allows for the data to be viewed on the website. Websites usually have images or pictures throughout the website.  There are many different file types that can be used for images depending on what you want. Jpeg, png or Gif are the most commonly used types for inserting pictures. If the correct file type is used it could lead to distorted images and poor usability of the website.
