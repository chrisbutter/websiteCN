<h1> Outcome 2

<h2> Outcome 2.1

<p>

    Creating my website required me to use programs such as Trello, Virtual studio code and multiple web browsers such as chrome or firefox. I used Trello to create a kanban style board that I used to plan out tasks that I needed to do. I kept this up to date to make it easier to see what tasks I have done and what I need doing. I kept adding tasks throughout to help me remember any new ideas that i wanted to implement so i did not forget about them. Virtual Studio code was used to create the HTML and CSS code that is fundamental to the creation and function of the website. HTML was used to create the backbone of my website and it contained all the information that was going to be available on the website. CSS was used for the format, layout and the look of the website in general such as the fonts, font colors, headings, pictures and navigation bar. I used multiple web browsers during the creation of the website so i could view the website constantly to see if my code was working as intended. This included items such as the insertion of pictures, changes to font/font color and posting of items.  I used more than one because sometimes I had issues with refreshing the page so having another at hand was essential to making the website. The web browser also allowed me to view any changes I made to the code such as the size and position of pictures.

<h2> Outcome 2.2

    <p>
        The tools I used for the creation of the website were Trello and Virtual code studio which were essential for me. Virtual code studio was used to create a HTML file  which was used to create the website that I wanted. I also created a CSS file which I used to create the look and feel of my website. It also allowed me to link both files together inside of the same program which made it easier for me to work on the website code in both CSS and HTML.
        Trello was used in the creation of a plan of tasks that needed to be done and was used throughout the process of the creation of my website. I can always add new tasks along the way to help improve my website and it also allows me to prioritize the tasks depending on the importance of them to the creation of the website. With the planning of a trello board and the option to add items it allowed me to make the best website I could within the time frame. If i didn't use trello and the kanban method it could have allowed me to forget the new ideas that i thought of during the creation of the website. Without the planning of tasks it could have created issues in the process of creating the site due to certain parts not being done which could have wasted time which could have a knock on effect later down the line. This could be time i could have added more features to make the website a lot better. The use of trello was of great importance to the completion of the site through its clear layout and ease of use throughout the creation of the website.

<h2> Outcome 2.3

    <p>
        With my website now completed I have had time to reflect on the finished website. Overall I am happy with what I have made but there are certain areas in which I could have improved. I am happy with the clean simple look I went for but I can see that some people could find it a bit plain and boring.  I do regret not adding more features like text background colours, more interesting backgrounds and changing the layout of the text. In general just use more of the dead space on the website sites pages to make it look more interesting. I was constantly refreshing the page in a web browser to see the changes I was making.   I was not happy with the amount of pages I had made. With the time frame and my coding skills I realized I would not have enough time to make each page as good as they could have been. So therefore I condensed the pages down so there is also scrolling to do on each page. I am happy with the picture on the main page and how it greets the user when opening the website. I also wished I did a much better job with the planning of the website to make it much easier to see the stages in which I create the website. I did not do a good job of keeping the trello board updated so i didn't have a clear way of knowing what i was doing and what the next task was. This affected the time I had to add features to the website and test it within the time frame.

<h2> Outcome 2.4

    <p>
        Now the website is complete I have had time to look back and see where i could improve the website. The layout of the website could have been better to make the website look better and more interesting for the users viewing pleasure. I did have more web pages on my site to help split up the amount of text on each page. Due to the amount of time i had i would not have finished each page so i had to change the number of pages. I could have also made changes to the font color and position throughout the webpage to make it look more professional. i could have also included more Jpeg and Gif images to help fill in some spaces on the web pages which could have also helped make the site overall more interesting. 
    </p>

    <h2> Outcome 2.5

        <p>

            When I had completed my website I reviewed it to make sure it matched the requirements that were set out. This included accessing the website constantly to make sure everything  was working at each stage. I also tested every aspect of the site to make sure it was working. This would have included testing every link on the website and making sure the text was positioned correctly and the right fonts were used. I also tested the navigation bar to make sure it worked and stayed visible on each page and it also stayed in the same position. Once I was happy that all the requirements were met and I was satisfied the website was in working order I submitted the website for review.
