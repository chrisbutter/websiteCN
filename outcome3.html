<h1> Outcome 3

    <h2> Outcome 3.1

<p>
    When making my website there were ways in which I could have been more efficient. The planning of my website using trello could have been laid out better with more information and ideas for what i wanted to implement. This would have made the website much easier and less stressful. Another issue was time, with me not planning out with trello to the best of my ability it also made certain tasks mopr time consuming so therefore i had less time to implement more features and make any changes which would have been beneficial to the creation of the website such as adding more features to my navigation bar that would allow you go select a specific section instead of the just the page. If this website it would have been easier to implement a lot more features due to the fact you could spread the workload between you. This would result in a better overall using experience both in the use and navigation of the site down to the design. Working with a team would also allow you to get the website finished early and have more time to fix any issues and also test the site and implement any changes that you find necessary. The downside to  working in a team could be an issue with the direction of the website being with the style of the webpage or the general layout giving you less pride in the finished website than you would if you would have done it on your own.

<h2> Outcome 3.2

<p>
    Good Productivity and efficiency is vital to making sure that the website will be finished on time and to the best of your ability.  There are ways you can help your productivity when working on the website. When you get stuck or find something is not working as it should it is in your best interest to take a break for 10 mins to clear your mind. This could allow you get a new perspective on the issue which could  allow you to fix an issue in a way you couldn't see before thus saving you time and stress. Also taking regular breaks during the day help keep up good productivity by giving your eyes a rest and also stretching your body since you have been sitting down looking at a screen for a vast amount of time. To improve  my efficiency I would start my website with a clear plan on what I wanted it to be. Changing your mind about details during the project could result in being less efficient due to the time you take to make the changes. For example choosing a different background which then clashes with the color of your fonts thus giving you more tasks which result in taking up valuable time on other aspects of the website.

<h2> Outcome 3.3

<p>
    The next time i do a project such as a website i would do a number of things differently. For starters before i start coding I would plan out and acquire all resources i would need so that it would allow me to just concentrate on coding thus improving my productivity. I would also make more use of the help I could receive either from teachers or my colleagues. This would be helpful in the event of coming across a problem that I am struggling to fix. Instead of taking time to find the issue myself asking a tutor would be more productive because they have more experience and knowledge so it will be quicker and less stressful to get the help thus improving productivity. Asking fellow colleagues for help or ideas is also good for productivity because they might have found some resources that could help me or they could help you with the issue if they have come across something similar to you. This is where tools such as slack or zoom cna help with productivity with ere chat function we can share links to websites which could help you and to ask questions or post your code if you wanted to. Zoom can also allow people to share your screen which can allow people to see problems and offer you guidance.

<h2> Outcome 3.4
  
 <p>
    Testing the website is vital to see if it is functioning correctly. To keep on top of any issues it is best to keep checking your work consatny by reading over what you have done to see if you have made any mistakes. You should also keep testing the website itself from within a browser regularly to make sure everything is where you want it and is doing what you intended. This includes items such as the font of your text and the color and also the position of the pictures, navigation bar and general layout of text.  Another way of testing is to share your website with other people  so you can gather feedback on your website. This could allow you to see things that aren't working or could be better that you might have overlooked such as text font and color for readability and the general layout of the page. It is best to test the website inside multiple browsers to make sure that  there are no issues that one might miss or be making because all browsers are different so it's better being safe than sorry. You can also use the console with the browser to check if there any issues that might not have picked up within your testing in virtual code studio.
