<h1>UNIT 1


<h2> The purpose of IT in modern business</h1>


<p>
    Businesses of today now rely on IT more than ever. This is mainly down to a lot of jobs and tasks being completed on computer devices such as a PC, laptop, tablet or even a smartphone. With all these devices being able to be used it offers a business more choice and flexibility on how and where their employees and work can this includes working from home or if they are traveling via train. Social media plays an important role in modern business now because it can be used to reach a large number of users globally.


    Social media applications such as Facebook, Twitter, instagram and LinkIn have vast amounts of users and can be integrated into how a company can do work. For example if you advertise a product you can push that onto Facebook where there would be potentially a larger pool of  customers. Applications like facebook also do targeted advertisements which they use an algorithm that tells them which of their users would have a greater interest in the product you are selling. IT also makes a company more work efficient with programmes that help plan and check what work people have done or are doing such as Trello. The cloud also helps businesses with their data being available to be accessed from off site and data can also be recovered if lost either due to a software issue or hardware. The cloud is also useful if you work on multiple devices because any work done on one device can be accessed from another. For example if you complete a job on your pc it will be then uploaded to the cloud with you could then view on your mobile device.

        <p>
            With It now playing an even bigger role in how businesses are run there has also been a large increase in the number of applications available to make jobs or tasks easier for colleges. Slack is a great program that enables people to communicate with each other either through text chat, voice chat or video call. This allows people to be in constant communication with each other. Slack also allows users to create their own channels which will  help to keep conversation separate to make it easier for people to see the relevant information. These channels can also be made private which will help people now that everything that is posted is relevant to them or if they are on a specific project that they don't want anyone else to have access to. Programs such as zoom and google hangouts are a fantastic way for small to large groups of employees to have a video chat or conference. These can also be used to share your screen with people to either share what you have done or if you have an issue that you can't solve.

        <P>
            Trello is a useful  programme to use to help plan any work. Trello allows people to be assigned tasks to do and it can be updated by people when their task has been completed so it makes it easier for people to track what has been done and where or what other people are currently doing.  Trello also keeps users notified of any changes whether it is a task removed, commented on or updated. If any changes are made they would either receive an email notification or a push notification on mobile devices. If there are a number of people using the trello board to make any changes at the same time it will be done in real time so there will be no delays on the data being updated. Trello also allows people to be added at any time. All you need is their email address and send them an invitation. Planning your projects properly will make it easier for people to know exactly the process of the project . It will also show the activities that will guide the project to its outputs and deliverables. With the planning of the project you will now have all the relevant information for you to estimate and define a project's outputs and scope. Having the plan complete will allow you to see all of the processes and tasks that need to be done for the project to be completed. Teamwork and good communication are essential for a project to be completed effectively. If there is a breakdown in communication it could result in certain tasks not being done properly or even forgotten about this could have a knock on effect for the rest of the project either with time or even the project's completion. Teamwork is equally important because if one person is struggling it would be in everyone's interest to help or it could once again have a knock on effect for the rest of the project due to a person falling behind.

    <h2>Outcome 1. 3


        <br>
<P>
    When planning a project I would use the Kanban method which shows you what you need to do then what's in process and finally what has been completed. This can be updated and changed by multiple people in real time and there would be no delay in the changes being updated for the other users to see. Using the keban method you could also use a traffic light system for users. For example red could be tasks that need doing, amber for tasks currently in the process of being done and finally green for tasks completed.  The keban method is what a Tello board uses and this makes it easy for users to clearly see what the stages each item is at. It can also be used to assign tasks to a specific person so they will know what tasks they need to be doing.

<h2>Outcome 1.4

    <br>
<P>
    There are many reasons that could lead to project failing ranging from hardware or software issues to a breakdown in communication. When a project is in  the process of being done at any time a person could have issues either with their hardware or software. This is an issue that could have no warning to it happening but it is a good idea to have backups in place just in case. Hardware for example you could have backups for individual hardware such as a keyboard, mouse, webcam or even another computer for example a laptop if your desktop fails you. If you have a software issue it could have even larger implications with the project if you haven't saved your work. This is where constant saving of your work is a priority and hardware could also have an issue with saved work. For example if the HDD fails you could have lost all your work so it is essential to have a cloud save setup to counter this issue. Another risk is that the project could be an internet connection. This could fail at any time so having a backup just in case is essential. This could be a secondary line for an office or another internet provider if the person is working from home. Another way for an employee working from home is they could either use their phone to work from  or use it to tether their connection to their laptop/PC. Viruses could have an effect on the project by infecting devices which would cause users to have unexpected down time. This could have consequences down the line because depending on the severity of the issue by the loss of work time. Poor planning of the project is something that could bring the project to its knees before it even begins. The planning needs to be done properly so you can see the whole process from beginning to end with clear tasks for each member and the process in which each task is done. Without this people will not know what they are supposed to be doing which could leave people doing nothing or even multiple people doing the same tasks simultaneously. Communication breakdown could have similar issues to poor planning. This issue could come from not updating the trello board or simply not using hangouts, zoom or slack to keep upto date and in constant communication with their fellow workers.

<h2>Outcome 1.5
    <br>
<p>
    Choosing what systems and software you are going to use depends on what project you are doing.  If the project requires people to be working on the move or you have multiple people you will need to make sure that the software is available across multiple devices. This includes desktop, laptop, tablets and mobile phones. You will also need to make sure that it is available on Windows, Mac os, iOs and android. The systems and software that you choose need to make the project run smoothly and effectively, limiting any chance of unforeseen issues which could cause delays in the project. The technology also needs to be adaptive to the scope of the project if then application is not designed to accommodate the project it could become confusing for employees to follow the plan. 
</p>



<h2>Outcome 1.6

<P>
    Trello is a piece of software which uses the Kanban method. This makes the planning and
    execution of a project clear and easy for people to follow. In Trello it allows people to be assigned individual tasks and it can be modified by multiple people at the same time. This allows a clear overview of the flow of the project by having different columns for the stages of the taks for example doing, review, done, completed. GIT is an open source distributed version control system which is a content tracker, this means it can be used to store content such as code. It can be used to store code which then can be changing if more code is added. More than one user a time can add code and it keeps a history of those changes. Git can be accessed on a server or it can be found on the personal computer of each user. This means each person has the same code which results in no code conflicts between users.

    <h2>Outcome 1.7

        <P>
            GDPR is the EU regulation regarding data privacy and security laws. There are penalties if any organization is found to have commited a offence, this could be a fine of up to 20 million euros or 4% of the global revenue whichever amount is the highest. The main area of concern is the amount of personal data being stored which can be accessed around the world. The personal data can include information such as Names, email address, location data, ethnicity, gender, biometric data, religion and political opinions. With large companies a project could either use multiple offices in different countries or outsource to another company altogether. This means that a large amount of data would be collected in order for the project to be completed, for example email dresses for trello,slack,hangout invitations. To help keep the data secured a process could be done to wipe the data either manually or automated when the project is completed. To secure access to programs it would be beneficial for the use of two factor authentication and also any data that is sorted should only be necessary for the project and should be encrypted
